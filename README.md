# Chelsea Finn
### history
She is the top famous research in RL/robotic/meta-learning realm. One of the famous student of Sergey Levine. She became well-known after  co-teaching Berkeley cs294 Deep reinforcement learning course with Sergey Levine in Spring 2017. Then she co-organized BAIR-camp, a 2 day summer camp on human-centered AI. At ICML2017, she gave a tutorial with Sergey Levine on Deep Reinforcement Learning, Decision Making, and Control. Besides, she is going to give a invited talk on meta-learning at NIPS2017.
